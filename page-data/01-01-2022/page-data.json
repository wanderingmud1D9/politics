While I\nwould prefer to discuss these topics more openly using my public identity, I am\ncurrently employed by an organization in education which is governed exclusively by\nleftists. Paradoxically, the history of this organization (and those associated\nwith it) holds my absolute awe and respect. I sincerely admire and still feel\nprivileged to be associated with this organization, but I do not misidentify\ncorruption in administration with the legacy of those seeking to advance the\ntrue mission of Western enlightenment values through education.</p>\n<p>For myself personally, I have been well-aware of many of the anti-democratic\nand anti-European movements which have now been emboldened to clearly assert\ntheir goals in the public for well more than 1.5 decades. Attempts to discuss\nthese topics with others in the past were met with ridicule and confusion; as\nsuch, I simply accepted that the types of crises which we are experiencing now\nwere inevitable.</p>\n<p>I sincerely find myself quite conflicted, as while such troubling times are very\ndisturbing to many, there has been much relief for me in having had my views\nvindicated, and now seeing so many forced to confront very ugly realities which\nhave been, to those such as myself, undeniably obvious for so many years.</p>\n<p>Thank you for your time as always, and I look forward to publishing on future\ntopics using this new space.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"A dedicated platform for my politics","date":"January 01, 2022","description":"An explanatory post for this blog"}},"previous":null,"next":null},"pageContext":{"id":"d95aebd5-3191-5f0f-b52d-9501e2abe2ba","previousPostId":null,"nextPostId":null}},
