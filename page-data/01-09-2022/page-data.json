It is a fortunate time for those such as myself; When I attempted to raise\nawareness of these threats while much younger, I was eagerly dismissed as a\nlunatic and ridiculed. This was a primary factor in my distancing from any and\nall political discussions prior to 2019. I had concluded that Westerners\n(particularly those neighboring me) would remain blind to their own\nself-destruction, and willingly embrace their own eradication or enslavement.\nToday, many Westerners, and most surprisingly, Europeans, are finally becoming\npolitically active in response to the constant attacks upon their own\nnational governments, heritage, personal liberties, and people.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 630px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/politics/static/ebb869cae49d0436ce26cced53867673/f1452/family_tv.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 81.64556962025317%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"family with television\"\n        title=\"family with television\"\n        src=\"/politics/static/ebb869cae49d0436ce26cced53867673/828fb/family_tv.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/politics/static/ebb869cae49d0436ce26cced53867673/ff44c/family_tv.jpg 158w,\n/politics/static/ebb869cae49d0436ce26cced53867673/a6688/family_tv.jpg 315w,\n/politics/static/ebb869cae49d0436ce26cced53867673/828fb/family_tv.jpg 630w,\n/politics/static/ebb869cae49d0436ce26cced53867673/0ede0/family_tv.jpg 945w,\n/politics/static/ebb869cae49d0436ce26cced53867673/f1452/family_tv.jpg 1103w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<h2>Media and Propaganda</h2>\n<p>Much of this would not have been possible without the usage of mass indoctrination\non behalf of the corporate media (as well as, in some cases, national\ngovernments as well). The technology most often used has been television,\nhowever, the rise of social media (most notably, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram,\nSnapchat, and TikTok) has provided further avenues by which to restrict and\ndistort the worldview of Western citizens.</p>\n<p>The beneficial impacts of television have been contentious at best. As a\nfoundational step towards the development of the personal computer and the\nestablishment of the World Wide Web, it has served as an incredible intermediary\ntechnology. However, by any sensible measure, the entertainment programming has\ndominated the airwaves and cable TV for many decades. The corporate news media,\nalong with televised sports have been the most successful in ensuring that the\ncitizenry stay restrained in their tolerance range for entertainment, and\ntrusted sources for information. One sees the impact of this made very obvious\ntoday with the advent of programs such as “Reliable Sources” and the usage of\n“fact-checkers” (a neologism crafted by those too illiterate to employ\nterms such as “editor” or “researcher”).</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 630px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/politics/static/d074225c3234686e6cf36716da76a933/044a9/United-Facts-Logo-2021-04-27.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 44.30379746835443%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"united facts of america: event hosted by the CNN cable news network\"\n        title=\"united facts of america: event hosted by the CNN cable news network\"\n        src=\"/politics/static/d074225c3234686e6cf36716da76a933/f058b/United-Facts-Logo-2021-04-27.png\"\n        srcset=\"/politics/static/d074225c3234686e6cf36716da76a933/c26ae/United-Facts-Logo-2021-04-27.png 158w,\n/politics/static/d074225c3234686e6cf36716da76a933/6bdcf/United-Facts-Logo-2021-04-27.png 315w,\n/politics/static/d074225c3234686e6cf36716da76a933/f058b/United-Facts-Logo-2021-04-27.png 630w,\n/politics/static/d074225c3234686e6cf36716da76a933/40601/United-Facts-Logo-2021-04-27.png 945w,\n/politics/static/d074225c3234686e6cf36716da76a933/78612/United-Facts-Logo-2021-04-27.png 1260w,\n/politics/static/d074225c3234686e6cf36716da76a933/044a9/United-Facts-Logo-2021-04-27.png 3036w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span>\n<em>Yes, this was a real event</em></p>\n<p>This used to impel the demographics of television fanatics to seek to demonize\nthose who seek alternative sources\nof news or information (typically in the form of the text or video recorded by\ncitizen journalists).</p>\n<p>That the World Wide Web has provided many with the freedom to share information more\nfreely and without restriction has provided the perfect narrative for the TV\ndogmatists to employ endlessly: information sources uncensored by media\nconglomorates and the state are being “hijacked” by some foreign or malicious\nentities for the purposes for spreading disinformation. Within the United\nStates, this false narrative most commonly uses the Russian Federation as the\nprimary culprit (often, to absurd and comedic extremes, such as implying that\nWikiLeaks is somehow an apparatus of the Russian Federation):</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden; margin-bottom: 1.0725rem\" > <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/bAMt1KMqXdM?start=37\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" style=\" position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \"></iframe> </div>\n<p>This is not to deny that the Russian Federation certainly does employ the usage\nof teams of individuals spreading disinformation using social media. However,\nthere are any number of other nations (namely, the People’s Republic of China,\nNorth Korea, and Iran) who have been exposed in the past for engaging in massive\ncyberattacks upon the United States. To assume that these nations are also not\nengage in spreading disinformation is naive and foolish.</p>\n<p>Further, what precisely constitutes a “Russian” disinformation campaign is never\nclearly outlined. Are these disinformation agents working on behalf of the\nRussian government? Are they employees of private firms working instead on\nbehalf of some unknown clients? Are these individuals <em>confirmed</em> as residing in\nRussia, or are they simply traced to an IP address located <em>in</em> Russia? (One\ncould very easily use a Virtual Private Network in order to achieve the latter).</p>\n<p>The government of the Russian Federation is not well-known for its leniency\nshown towards any form of cybercrime, and there are documented cases in which\ngovernment agencies have cooperated with the United States in order to prosecute\nand incarcerate suspects:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/1/15/russia-says-it-took-down-revil-hacking-group-at-us-request\">Russia says it dismantled REvil hacking group at US request</a></p>\n<p>And what of other nations? Latin America? Other European nations? Gulf\nArab nations? Black hat criminals operating in Canada or Australia? The absence\nof any reported attacks originating from so many nations with well-established\nweb infrastructure is extremely curious.</p>\n<h2>Media and Globalisation</h2>\n<p>Often in coordination with the continued adoption of television throughout the\nglobe has been the extension of a specific form of cultural imperialism. From\napproximately the 1970’s onwards, much of this has consisted of leveraging the\nappeal of television to those outside of the United States to the advantage of\nmultinational corporations seeking to promote their products or services to new,\nforeign demographics.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden; margin-bottom: 1.0725rem\" > <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MdcWK7axuH8?start=37\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" style=\" position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \"></iframe> </div>\n<p>This post could not possibly endeavor to provide a thorough outline of the\nprocess of globalisation. However, it is quite clear that, by the arrival of\n1980 within the US, this process had clearly begun to amass critical momentum.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden; margin-bottom: 1.0725rem\" > <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ckbfS99N6jY?start=37\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" style=\" position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \"></iframe> </div>\n<p>The first amongst those to stand opposed to the consumption of US and Western\nmedia outlets were religious fundamentalists and Marxist-Leninists.

And for many,\nexposing their children to harmless advertisements for products such as Fruit\nLoops or McDonald’s cheeseburgers seemed harmless enough. Thus, most willingly\nembraced an extremely restrictive, controlled form of media as a luxury; this\nwas to be considered a benefit of living within a modern, developed nation.</p>\n<h3>The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)</h3>\n<p>Signed into law by President William J. Clinton in 1994 (although, this\nagreement was architected primarily by predecessor George H. W. Bush), the NAFTA\nfundamentally damaged the industrial manufacturing base of the US. Under the\nClinton administration, one began to see a number of fundamental, destructive\nchanges within the United States, some of which included:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Massive outsourcing of labor within the automotive industry</li>\n<li>Destruction of the semiconductor and steel manufacturing industries</li>\n<li>The fabrication of the fictional firearms class “assault weapon”, and\nsubsequent restrictions impose upon their sale.</li>\n<li>In 1990, Walmart became the largest US retailer by revenue. By 1997,\nWalmart was added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The rise of Walmart as\nthe dominant retail outlet inflicted significant damage upon small business\nowners across the US.</li>\n<li>The involvement of NATO forces (including US combat aircraft) in the\nintentional targeting of Serbian civilians during the Yugoslav Wars. To date,\nno Western leaders have been held responsible for their involvement in these\natrocities.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The massive unemployment triggered by these oncoming waves of outsourcing to\nmanufacturing facilities outside of the US were responded to by political\nleadership with promises of increased resources provided using social welfare\nprograms. Clinton specifically sought to appeal to the demographic of Black\nAmericans, constituting approximately 12.7% of the US population as of 1997 <sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup>.\nTo quote Nobel Prize-winning author Toni Morrison (herself Black American):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Clinton displays almost every trope of blackness: single-parent household,\nborn poor, working-class, saxophone-playing, McDonald’s-and-junk-food-loving\nboy from Arkansas <sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It must also be noted that the US Census at 1997, Hispano-American (termed\n“Hispanic Origin Status”) are disambiguated from White, Black, American Indian,\nEskimo, Aleut, Asian, and Pacific Islanders. They were reported to constitute\napproximately 18.3% of the US population in 1997 <sup id=\"fnref-3\"><a href=\"#fn-3\" class=\"footnote-ref\">3</a></sup>. To date, we have yet to\nhave a US President who “displays almost every trope of” Hispano-American cultural\nidentity.</p>\n<h3>Entertainment Media and Television</h3>\n<p>The early and mid-1990’s saw the rise of a significantly more prosperous and\nwell-entrenched music industry, which most notably established its reign over\nthe members of “Generation X” and “Millenial Generation” using the introduction\nof VH1 and Music Television (MTV) over cable television. While there would be\nperiodic challenges from select genres of music, this period would come to\nconcentrate the power to direct popular taste in music within a select number of\nrecord industry corporations. This would also initiate a period in music which\nhas yet to fully conclude; the rise of Hip Hop as a popular genre amongst\nupper-middle class White young adolescents.</p>\n<p>To provide some context for this, it may be useful to review the pace of change\nin popular music genres and styles prior to 1994:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1956 Release of “Hound Dog” covered by Elvis Presley (Rockabilly)\n<ul>\n<li>(this remained the top-selling release on the pop chart for 11 weeks; a 36-year record)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>1964 Release of “Introducing…The Beatles” (Rock and Roll, released from the UK)</li>\n<li>1969 Release of “Led Zeppelin” (Hard rock and blues rock, released from the UK)</li>\n<li>1969 Release of “Live/Dead” by the Grateful Dead (Psychedelic and blues rock)</li>\n<li>1970 Release of “Black Sabbath” (Heavy metal)</li>\n<li>1971 Release of “ZZ Top’s First Album” by the ZZ Top (Texas blues rock)</li>\n<li>1972 Release of “The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust…” by the David Bowie (Glam Rock)</li>\n<li>1975 Release of “Jive Talkin’” by the Bee Gees (Disco)</li>\n<li>1977 Release of “Never Mind the Bollocks, Here’s the Sex Pistols” by the Sex Pistols (Punk Rock)</li>\n<li>1980 Release of “Freedom of Choice” by Devo (Synth-pop)</li>\n<li>1980 Release of “Face Value” by the Phil Collins (Pop rock)</li>\n<li>1986 Release of “Reign in Blood” by Slayer (Thrash metal)</li>\n<li>1988 Release of “Open Up and Say… Ahh!” by Poison (Glam metal)</li>\n<li>1990 Release of “Violator” by Depeche Mode (Synth-pop)</li>\n<li>1991 Release of “Nevermind” by Nirvana (Grunge)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From the mid-1990’s, throughout the 2000’s, 2010’s, and until 2022, change in popular\nmusic genres came to an extreme halt.
