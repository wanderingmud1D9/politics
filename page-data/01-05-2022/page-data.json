Trump from 2016 onwards, the extent to which the\nwritings of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels have been repeatedly referenced has\nbeen quite shocking. That individuals would refer to themselves (unironically)\nas “Marxists” during any year following the early 1990’s seems to be quite\nanachronistic. This is particularly striking given that the more vocal\nself-described “Marxists” have been White/European members of the upper middle\nclass, and often have been slavishly obedient to corporate consumer culture.</p>\n<h2>Muh Marxism Tho</h2>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 630px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/politics/static/696ba430d3d7f12f2f90a59783891d86/ac99c/faux_marxism.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 133.54430379746836%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAAbABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGAABAQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAABAgP/xAAWAQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADAgH/2gAMAwEAAhADEAAAAXkD6Tro8Sm63VJUOm//xAAdEAADAAICAwAAAAAAAAAAAAABAgMAEhEiBBMh/9oACAEBAAEFAjUIqV6lhnO2UQJnrocn88ilA7brjDkRHWajT//EABgRAAIDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAhARAR/9oACAEDAQE/AYRtM//EABcRAAMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABETH/2gAIAQIBAT8BapDCI//EAB8QAAICAQQDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAhEhIjFBUTJhcf/aAAgBAQAGPwJu16NTybiUss5XXRdxIuSpXyb4PJDJv6I//8QAHxABAAICAgIDAAAAAAAAAAAAAQARITFBUWFxgZGh/9oACAEBAAE/IStdX2l97l1BOQfMN9R13H+Z2q0+55o8S1ISzwIIbgxUxlQK2ckAJuh+RaVP/9oADAMBAAIAAwAAABBcI/z/xAAYEQADAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAREhMf/aAAgBAwEBPxBnoo7iKP/EABcRAQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAESH/2gAIAQIBAT8QEY2JXpmP/8QAHRABAQEBAQADAQEAAAAAAAAAAREhADFBUXFhwf/aAAgBAQABPxDRAdNGM4thrAVHxnQSHsRwqI6DP1nCrFAvkEfxeYPEvt/3lUEsR0d+veBwq9YlrPqTjQZCaPNRKEPzru8UGQv8vOZm0rFO/9k='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"marxist with apple products and starbucks coffee\"\n        title=\"marxist with apple products and starbucks coffee\"\n        src=\"/politics/static/696ba430d3d7f12f2f90a59783891d86/828fb/faux_marxism.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/politics/static/696ba430d3d7f12f2f90a59783891d86/ff44c/faux_marxism.jpg 158w,\n/politics/static/696ba430d3d7f12f2f90a59783891d86/a6688/faux_marxism.jpg 315w,\n/politics/static/696ba430d3d7f12f2f90a59783891d86/828fb/faux_marxism.jpg 630w,\n/politics/static/696ba430d3d7f12f2f90a59783891d86/0ede0/faux_marxism.jpg 945w,\n/politics/static/696ba430d3d7f12f2f90a59783891d86/3ac88/faux_marxism.jpg 1260w,\n/politics/static/696ba430d3d7f12f2f90a59783891d86/ac99c/faux_marxism.jpg 1536w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>For myself, I am completely unable to interpret the precise origins of this\nbehavior. It may well be rooted in illiteracy, as often times one finds a\nreference to this strange phrase “market socialism”:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The idea was: socialism was planning; but there were others who said, no, socialism\nis about how you organize the society as a whole; how you organize production;\nhow you organize politics and culture; but there is no problem in a socialist society\nusing markets to distribute resources and products, letting different enterprises bargain\nand negotiate with one another, and accomplish distribution, that way the\nlatter group was called market socialists, and the other one was called\nplanned socialists.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden; margin-bottom: 1.0725rem\" > <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8pjpS0q9efw?start=113\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" style=\" position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \"></iframe>; </div>\n<p>While there is no doubt that, during the decades following 1960, there were many\nwho identified as these “market socialists”, were these “Marxists”?</p>\n<p>A brief survey of some publications by economic historians clearly indicates that\nMarx and Engels did not, ever clearly state that markets had any role to be play\nin their forecasted socialist revolutions to come. To quote Marx himself:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘Within the cooperative society based on common ownership of the means of\nproduction’, he wrote, ‘the producers do not exchange their products’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-349-22572-9_14\">Roosevelt F.

(eds) Economics as Worldly Philosophy.</a></p>\n<p>Further, there have been numerous topics, decades old, which have been published\naddressing this recurring problem of self-identifying Marxists claiming that\nMarx and Engels felt that a market was fundamental to a socialist revolution:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/150784\">Nove, Alec. “‘Market Socialism’ and Its Critics.” Soviet Studies 24, no. 1(1972): 120–38.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/4407136\">Chattopadhyay, P.

Marx, Communism, and Markets. Political Theory, 15(2), 182–204.</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Non-Marxist Socialists?</h2>\n<p>I am not at all knowledgeable on social philosophers who presented themselves as\nsocialists contra Marx/Engels, but more prominent figures (again, from the 19th\ncentury) which sought some radical anti-competitive alternative to capitalism\nincluded the likes of Ferdinand Lassalle, David Ricardo, and Pierre-Joseph\nProudhon. While fascinating to research, there are rarely cases in which any of\nthese influential anti-capitalists have really had some significant role or\nimpact on contemporary, Western faux-Marxism. More importantly, these individuals\neven further distanced themselves from market-driven economics (with some\npossible exceptions found in Proudhon and their followers; but certainly nothing\ncomparable to what is found in the love of the faux-Marxists for their NFL\nmerchandise, Starbucks drinks, and Apple products).</p>\n<h2>Degenerate Consumerism?</h2>\n<p>I have, and often still, speculate that these social movements seem to have\ntheir roots, instead, in a long-standing hatred of the upper-middle class for\nwhite, rural members of the working class (as well as the poor). I find it\ncurious that, in juxtaposition to past attempts to foster a sense of solidarity\nbetween white workers, non-westerners, and socialist intellectuals, there is a\npeculiar loathing elitism to be found amongst these leftists. Take, for example,\nthe phenomenon of the “white trash party”:</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 550px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/politics/static/a976521719ac188285f2c4ffbd4d4a0d/d7854/white_trash_party.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 83.54430379746836%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"white trash party\"\n        title=\"white trash party\"\n        src=\"/politics/static/a976521719ac188285f2c4ffbd4d4a0d/d7854/white_trash_party.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/politics/static/a976521719ac188285f2c4ffbd4d4a0d/ff44c/white_trash_party.jpg 158w,\n/politics/static/a976521719ac188285f2c4ffbd4d4a0d/a6688/white_trash_party.jpg 315w,\n/politics/static/a976521719ac188285f2c4ffbd4d4a0d/d7854/white_trash_party.jpg 550w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>Here one finds the German-born model Heidi Klum engaged in a public ritual of scorn\nand mockery for the poorest classes of US-American whites. Further, it should\nalso be noted that this was a wedding ceremony in which Klum was being married\nto the musician Seal (Henry Olusegun Adeola Samuel). Seal, like Klum, was also\nnot a native US-American citizen, being born in the United Kingdom.</p>\n<p>This is not a new phenomenon, as the marriage was held in 2005. One could even\nattempt to connect this strange intraracial hatred of poor and working class\nwhites by white members of the upper-middle class to the early 1970s. Less\nfortunate US-American whites who were unable to avoid conscription and having\nbeen forced to survive the horrors of Vietnam, arrived at long last to their\nhomes only to find upper-middle class whites screaming “baby killer” and\nspitting upon them:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I mean, they called us “baby killers”, everything you could think of. And like I\nsaid I was getting on a plane, they spit on us and…it wasn’t, it wasn’t\ngood.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden; margin-bottom: 1.0725rem\" > <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/bzWs2Uu8I9c?start=27\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" style=\" position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \"></iframe> </div>\n<h2>Conclusions</h2>\n<p>While these are just speculations, I still do strongly feel that these\nundercurrents indicate that the roots of these movements lie with a hateful\ndisgust for those members of US-American society who sacrificed themselves\nfor this nation, and now find themselves the target of\npersecution by those they sought to protect. While these circumstances are\nextremely tragic, I do actually find some optimism within the gloom of the\nmodern era.
