&lt;p&gt;This is to serve as a platform dedicated to my own discussions addressing points
related to contemporary politics and fundamental philosophical movements which
have affected us all throughout the past two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to clarify my purpose behind this approach which I am taking, I have long
held views which lie antithetical to the US-American leftists (typically these
individuals today, refer to themselves as “Marxists” or “socialists”). While I
would prefer to discuss these topics more openly using my public identity, I am
currently employed by an organization in education which is governed exclusively by
leftists. Paradoxically, the history of this organization (and those associated
with it) holds my absolute awe and respect. I sincerely admire and still feel
privileged to be associated with this organization, but I do not misidentify
corruption in administration with the legacy of those seeking to advance the
true mission of Western enlightenment values through education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For myself personally, I have been well-aware of many of the anti-democratic
and anti-European movements which have now been emboldened to clearly assert
their goals in the public for well more than 1.5 decades. Attempts to discuss
these topics with others in the past were met with ridicule and confusion; as
such, I simply accepted that the types of crises which we are experiencing now
were inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sincerely find myself quite conflicted, as while such troubling times are very
disturbing to many, there has been much relief for me in having had my views
vindicated, and now seeing so many forced to confront very ugly realities which
have been, to those such as myself, undeniably obvious for so many years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your time as always, and I look forward to publishing on future
topics using this new space.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
